# Portfolio Website

Here is my portfolio website. I use it to showcase some of the project I've worked on in my free time. I also have some information regarding my technical background on it. The theme is called **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)**.

If you look through the commit history, you will see that for a long time I used a website that I coded and designed myself. I chose to make the move to use a theme template because of its simplicity, which has saved me quite a few headaches.
