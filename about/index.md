I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Milliman in Seattle, WA. I primarily enjoy working with
progressive front-end technologies to create interactive user interfaces. These technologies include, but are not limited to, JavaScript (ES6), React.js, jQuery, Sass, and bundlers like webpack. I also work closely with testing frameworks such as Selenium. I am a graduate of the University of Washington in Seattle, WA.


## How I got into Programming

I initially became interested in programming during college. I always enjoyed the mixture of creativity and critical thinking required to write code. Out of the computer science courses I took, I was always more interested in the ones that were more front-end oriented. And by the end of college, I had research and intern experience involving software. It was then when I transitioned into my career as a full-time developer.
