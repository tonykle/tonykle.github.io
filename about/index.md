I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Milliman in Seattle. I primarily enjoy working with
front-end technologies but am willing to work with whatever necessary to get the job done. I am a graduate of the University of Washington C/O 2015.

## How I got into Programming

I became interested in programming during my time in college. Out of the computer science courses I took, I was always more interested in the ones that were more front-end oriented. By my the end of my senior year of college, I had research and intern experience involving software. It was then when I transitioned into my career as a full-time developer.
